# What is programming language?

Programming language comprises [a set of instructions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instruction_set) for computer to produce various kinds of output.

Computer (CPU) only understand instructions in binary code. Binary code is hard for human being to create and manage. Programming languages are created as an bridge from human language to the binary code, which computer can understand and execute directly.

Programming languages must be translated to the binary code before computer can run it. This translation is call "compiled" or "interpreted". No matter what programming language used, you must use a compiler or interpreter to convert it into a form that computer can understand, which is binary code.
